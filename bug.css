The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, if you use `calc()` to calculate a width based on the parent element's width, but the parent element's width is not yet defined when the calculation is performed, the calculation will result in an unexpected value. This can lead to layout issues, such as elements being displayed incorrectly or overlapping.
